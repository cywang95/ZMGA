# ZMGA: A ZINB-based Multi-modal Graph Autoencoder Enhancing Topological Consistency in Single-Cell Clustering


**Brief introduction:**
ZMGA is a topologically consistent multi-modal graph autoencoder. Specifically, a Triple-graph Alignment module has been developed, utilizing compressed embeddings in the latent space to reconstruct graphs and ensure consistency in the topological structures of the reconstructed graphs with those of the topological graphs of each modality. Furthermore, to compress information effectively and model the distribution of real cell data accurately, we developed both a reconstruction module and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)  module.

**Code Availability:**
Thank you for your interest in my project. The code is currently under active development and is slated for imminent release. Please stay tuned for forthcoming updates. Should you have any inquiries or suggestions, feel free to communicate through Issues.
